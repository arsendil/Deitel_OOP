Student – Base Class
This is the top-level class that represents all students, regardless of their level. It might contain shared attributes and behaviors such as:

Student ID
Admission year
Contact information
This class defines the common interface for all types of students.2. UndergraduateStudent and GraduateStudent
These two classes inherit from Student.
 UndergraduateStudent represents bachelor's degree students.
 GraduateStudent represents master's and doctoral students.
They both inherit all shared attributes from Student, but can also add more specific properties or methods, such as enrollment status, thesis requirements, or course types.
3. Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior
These all inherit from UndergraduateStudent and represent the academic year of the student:
Freshman – 1st year
Sophomore – 2nd year
Junior – 3rd year
Senior – 4th year
Each subclass could specialize behavior based on the year—for example, which courses they're allowed to take, academic advising level, or access to internships.4. MastersStudent and DoctoralStudent

MastersStudent is typically enrolled in a 1–2 year master's program.

Having a thesis or dissertation
Working under an academic advisor
