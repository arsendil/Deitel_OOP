Ease of reuse in inheritance
Members marked protected are accessible to child classes, allowing for easier extension without needing getters/setters.
Faster development and simpler interfaces
Derived classes can directly access necessary internal data, speeding up coding and reducing boilerplate.
Fine-grained control
You can expose parts of a class to its descendants while still hiding them from outside users.

Stronger encapsulation
private completely hides data from any class outside the one that declares it â€” even derived classes.
This helps maintain strict control over internal data.
Better maintainability
Since derived classes can't rely on private members, you can safely modify the internal implementation of the base class without risking breaking the subclasses.

Some developers feel that protected breaks encapsulation by exposing internal data to external entities (i.e., subclasses).
It can create tighter coupling between base and derived classes, making the design more fragile or harder to refactor.
Use private by default to enforce encapsulation, and only use protected when you know subclasses genuinely need direct access to certain members.
