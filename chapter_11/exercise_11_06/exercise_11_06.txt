Exercise 11.6

Implicit conversions in C++ can be performed using conversion constructors, which are single-argument constructors that convert values of other types (including fundamental types) into objects of a given class.

A typical use case is converting const char* C-style strings into objects of a user-defined String class.
Another example is in a Complex class, where an int or double can be implicitly converted into a Complex object by treating the given value as the real part of the number.
Similarly, in a HugeInteger class, an int value may be converted into a HugeInteger object by expanding the number into an array of digits.

However, implicit conversions can sometimes introduce logical errors when conversions happen unexpectedly. For instance, converting a const char* into a String object automatically may not always be desirable. In such cases, it's better to use the explicit keyword to prevent implicit construction and enforce that conversions be made intentionally.

This ensures code clarity and avoids bugs caused by unintended type conversions.
