Hereâ€™s the explanation of the class relationships in English:
Base Class
Shape 
This is the top-level base class.
All shapes inherit from this class.
First Level
TwoDimensionalShape (inherits from Shape)
ThreeDimensionalShape (inherits from Shape)
Second Level (2D Shapes)
TwoDimensionalShape is further divided into: 
Triangle 
Could have subclasses like EquilateralTriangle, IsoscelesTriangle, etc.
Circle 
Subclasses include: Square, Rhombus, Trapezoid, Pentagon, Hexagon, Octagon
All these subclasses inherit from TwoDimensionalShape.
Second Level (3D Shapes)
ThreeDimensionalShape is further divided into: 
Cylinder 
Subclasses: Tetrahedron, Cube, Cuboid, Octahedron, Dodecahedron, Icosahedron, Ellipsoid
Cone 
Subclasses: Sphere, SquarePyramid, TriangularPyramid, PentagonalPyramid
All these subclasses inherit from ThreeDimensionalShape.
Summary of relationships
Shape -> base class
TwoDimensionalShape and ThreeDimensionalShape -> direct subclasses of Shape
All other shapes (Triangle, Circle, Cone, Cylinder, etc.) -> inherit from their corresponding intermediate class (TwoDimensionalShape or ThreeDimensionalShape).
