Describe precisely how the HugeInteger class works

The HugeInteger class is designed to represent and manipulate arbitrarily large non-negative integers (up to 60 digits by default, configurable via the SIZE macro). It simulates big-integer arithmetic using an array of single digits, stored in base-10. Each digit is stored in an element of the fixed-size array digits_[], with the most significant digit at index 0 and the least significant digit at index SIZE - 1.

The class supports:

    Constructors from int, long, const char*, and copy construction

    Arithmetic operators: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/)

    Comparison operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=

    I/O stream operators: << and >> for formatted output/input

    Helper functions like isZero(), init(), getCount() for internal operations

The implementation manually performs arithmetic similarly to how humans do it on paper:

    Addition and subtraction handle carry/borrow digit-by-digit.

    Multiplication multiplies each digit and shifts accordingly.

    Division repeatedly subtracts the divisor from portions of the dividend to build the quotient.

Each operation creates and returns a new HugeInteger instance rather than modifying the current one, ensuring immutability of the operands.

What limitations does the class have?

The current implementation of the HugeInteger class has several notable limitations:

    Fixed Maximum Length:

        The number of digits is limited by the SIZE macro (default: 60).

        This means numbers longer than SIZE digits cannot be represented or processed.

    Only Non-Negative Integers:

        There is no support for negative numbers or sign handling.

        Subtracting a larger number from a smaller one gives incorrect results without signaling an error.

    No Overflow/Error Handling:

        The class does not check for overflows in arithmetic operations.

        If addition or multiplication exceeds SIZE, excess digits are silently lost.

    Slow Division:

        The division implementation uses repeated subtraction (brute-force), which is very inefficient for large numbers.

    No Assignment or Move Semantics:

        While the compiler-generated assignment/copy constructors work, the class does not provide custom ones, and thereâ€™s no move constructor/assignment.

    Limited Input Validation:

        The constructor from const char* and operator>> assume valid numeric strings without extra error checking for non-digits or excessive length.

    No Base Support:

        The class is hardcoded to base-10 (POWER = 10). It cannot be easily adapted to binary, hex, or arbitrary bases.

    Static Memory:

        The internal array is statically sized, using more memory than necessary for small numbers, and can't be resized dynamically.
