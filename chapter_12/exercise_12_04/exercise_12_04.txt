Software Reuse

Through inheritance, new classes can be created based on existing ones. This allows:
Avoiding code duplication
Using already tested and reliable components
Focusing only on implementing new functionality

Time Saving During Development

Inheritance makes it possible to quickly build new classes by extending existing code. As a result:
Developers spend less time writing new code
Development becomes faster and more efficient
Team projects benefit from standardized hierarchies and shared code

Error Prevention

Since inherited classes reuse tested functionalities from base classes:
The chance of introducing new bugs is reduced
Fixing bugs in the base class automatically benefits all derived classes
The structured hierarchy makes the program easier to understand and harder to misuse

Inheritance is a powerful tool that supports efficient software development.
It enables code reuse, saves developers time, and reduces errors by leveraging proven solutions.
