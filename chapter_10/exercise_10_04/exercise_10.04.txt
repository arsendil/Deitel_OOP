Exercise 10.4

friendship is a feature that allows a function, another class, or a method to access the private and protected members of a class.

By default, private and protected members of a class are not accessible from outside the class. However, by declaring another function or class as a friend, you're explicitly granting access to those internal parts.

One of the key principles of object-oriented programming is data hiding. Friendship allows external code to access private data, which violates this principle,
Friend functions and classes create strong dependencies between modules. Changes in one class may force changes in its friend class or function.
Too many friend relationships make it harder to isolate and reuse code, reducing maintainability.
Overusing friendship can lead to poor design, where internal data is exposed unnecessarily, leading to fragile and error-prone code.
