Exercise 13.07

Static Binding (early binding)
Happens at compile time
Used for non-virtual functions
Fast and direct call
Example: obj.print();

Dynamic Binding (late binding)
Happens at runtime
Used for virtual functions
Enables polymorphism
Example: ptr->print(); when print() is virtual

How Virtual Functions & vtable Work
Each class with virtual functions has a vtable: a table of function pointers.
Each object has a hidden pointer called vptr that points to its classâ€™s vtable.
When a virtual function is called (e.g., e->earnings();), the program:

Follows vptr to the vtable
Finds the correct function
Calls it dynamically at runtime
