Exercise 13.9

Additional levels of abstract base classes can be introduced between Shape and its derived classes to better organize the hierarchy. For example:

Between Shape and TwoDimensionalShape/ThreeDimensionalShape, you could add an intermediate abstract class like PolygonalShape for shapes with polygonal boundaries.
Another option is to introduce classes such as CurvedShape for shapes with curved edges.
You could also have a level distinguishing between RegularShape (with equal sides/angles) and IrregularShape.
These additional abstract classes help group shapes by shared characteristics and allow for more specialized interfaces and functionality at different abstraction levels.
