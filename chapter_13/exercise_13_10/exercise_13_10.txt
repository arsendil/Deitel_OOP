Exercise 13.10

Polymorphism contributes to extensibility because it allows a program to work with different implementations through a common interface.
This means you can add new classes or modify the behavior of existing ones without changing the code that uses that interface.
It makes the system more flexible, simplifies adding new functionality, and reduces the impact of changes on other parts of the program.
