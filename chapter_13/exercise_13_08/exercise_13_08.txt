Exercise 13.8

Virtual functions:

Have an implementation (body) in the base class.
Can be overridden in derived classes but don't have to be.
Objects of the base class can be created.

Pure virtual functions:

Declared by assigning = 0 in the base class (e.g., virtual void f() = 0;).
Have no implementation in the base class.
Must be overridden in derived classes.
Make the base class abstract, so you cannot instantiate objects of it.
